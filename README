This is a simple utility to light up a "USB Mail Notifier" device.  I got mine from http://www.chinavasion.com/cool-gadgets/webmail-notifiermail/, but the packaging is exactly the same as http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.27062 
As seen in the deal extreme screenshot, the device is also known as "Webmail window"

USE:
on the command line/Terminal:
./usbnotifierosx_cli <color_number> <blink time>
is no parameters, it'll blink blue for 10seconds
color numbers are:
off: 0
blue: 1
red: 2
green: 3
light blue: 4
purple: 5
yellow-green: 6
white: 7
